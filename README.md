# workflow.vim

I take lots of notes in vim for lots of different purposes and in lots of different ways. Over time
I've started to notice several distinct note taking workflows, and there are a number of patterns
and features that are shared between some or all of these workflows.

- *Directory structure:* Each workflow has a single directory which contains all the files relevant
  for that workflow. Within that directory there is a predictable path structure that is
consistently applied for all files within that workflow, but not necessarily the same as for any
other workflows. Sometimes the directory structure is nested, sometimes it's flat.

- *File type:* Although not all note-like files share the same filetype, all files within a
  particular workflow share the same filetype.

- *File naming conventions:* Many workflows contain files of the form 'YYYY-MM-DD' or
  'YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE' where the date is almost always the date the file was first created. All my
workflows use only word chars and '-' in the file names.

- *On load commands:* For each workflow there are is a very specific set of vim commands that I want
  executed immediately.

This plugin is designed to make the creation of a set of note-taking-workflow specific vim commands,
as simple as configuring a few variables.

For example this configuration...

``` {.vim}
let g:struct_workflows = {
      \"Blog":    {
      \             'root': '~/blog/posts',
      \             'date': 1,
      \             'mandatory-title': 1,
      \             'ext': 'html'
      \           }
      \}
```

... will create a `:Blog <title>` command that creates a new blog post. It does this by opening a
new html file in `~/blog/posts`, naming the file using todays date (YYYY-MM-DD), followed by the title
with non-word chars removed and spaces replaced with dashes, so `:Blog This is awesome` would open
`~/blog/posts/2014-12-01-this-is-awesome.html` (assuming the command was executed on 1st December
2014)

That configuration will also create matching TBlog, SBlog and VBlog commands to open the file in a
new tab, split and vert split respectively.

## Upcoming features

The following features aren't working yet, but will any luck I'll add them soon.

- Autocompletion for all Ex commands
- On open commands, that run when a new buffer is opened
